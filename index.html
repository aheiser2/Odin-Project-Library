    Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on 
    the page. You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their 
    own “card”. It might help for now to manually add a few books to your 
    array so you can see the display.
    Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input 
    the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether 
    it’s been read and anything else you might want. You will most likely 
    encounter an issue where submitting your form will not do what you expect 
    t to do. That’s because the submit input tries to send the data to a 
    server by default. If you’ve done the bonus section for the calculator 
    assignment, you might be familiar with event.preventDefault();. Read 
    p on the event.preventDefault documentation again and see how you can 
    solve this issue!
    Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
        You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book 
        objects in some way. One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute 
        that corresponds to the index of the library array.
    Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
        To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a 
        book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.

NOTE: You’re not required to add any type of storage right now. You will have 
the option to come back to this project later on in the course.
